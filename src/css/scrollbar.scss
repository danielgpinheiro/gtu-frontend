/**
 * Like, basically PERFECT scrollbars
 */

/*
   It's pure CSS.
   Since a quick google search will confirm people going crazy about Mac OS Lion scrollbars...
   this has no fade-out effect.

   In Mac OS Lion, the lowest common denominator is always showing scrollbars by a setting.
   So, this fits that lowest common denominator.

   Facebook, lifehacker, and Google have all basically taken this approach. Of course Google uses incredibly ugly square scrollbars, but so be it.
   Also, in regards to the fade in/out effect, this may just be one reason why soo many people outraged (and still hide) the ticker.

   Ending note: I recommend this for non-lion users. As a lion user, I prefer my fading out scrollbars. If you sniff a UA of mac os lion, don't add this css.
